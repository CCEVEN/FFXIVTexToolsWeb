    Application:
     - Updated to latest version of Helix Toolkit.
     - Added new steam directory name "FINAL FANTASY XIV Online" to common install directories.
     - Help > Check For Problems now does a more thorough check.
     - Changed .modlist and saved directory to MyDocument/TexTools so that it is shared by all newer version of TexTools.
     - User settings from this version onward should now persist as new versions are released.
     - Help > Report Bug now opens a new link to a public issue tracker.
     - Added a whole bunch of additional safeguards and checks for importing.
     - Added a crash dialog with information that can be copied to clipboard for bug reports.
 
    3D:
     - Meshes in the .dae file no longer have to be in order when importing.
     - Secondary Texture coorindates now export and import (used for decals/face paints).
     - Extra data used to hide mesh parts when overlaid by another mesh now imports and updates (this should fix a lot of issues).
     - Faces now import correctly.
     - Slight increase in emissive intensity in 3D viewer.
     - Added a notice for the model in Character > Body stating that it is not the default model when unequipped.
     - Added initial support for importing from blender (must use "Better Collada exporter" from here https://github.com/godotengine/collada-exporter)

     - Fixed an issue where textures would not appear correctly on 3D model when the texture width was greater than its height.
     - Fixed an issue where the model for Hyur Midlander Female in Charater > Body would not display.
     - Fixed an issue where imported model indices could be read incorrectly under certain circumstances.
     - Fixed an issue where offset was being set to 0 when importing an item with a larger data size than that already in the modlist.
     - Fixed an issue where some exported models had incorrect skinning (eg. Yotsuyu body[9130]), also fixes incorrect skinning on import.
     - Fixed an issue where certain models would not display in 3D (eg. Raubahn[9095]).
     - Fixed an issue where under certain circumstances information would be saved incorrectly to the modlist causing file pointer issues.
     - Other minor bug fixes
