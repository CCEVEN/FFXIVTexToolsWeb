    Application:
     - Changed texture type to reflect selections in photoshop export options.
     - Added Mipmap count to texture display to make it easier to determine whether Generate MIP maps option is necessary.
     - Added additional checks to determine issues on Textools startup.

    3D:
     - Added additional safeguards to importing when required data is missing.

    Bug Fixes:
     - Fixed an issue where certain textures were unable to be exported because of "Illegal characters in path".
     - Fixed an issue where models being imported that had index data count > 16,000 were not being split into separate parts causing the game to crash.
     - Fixed an issue where index data and blend indices were not being combined correctly when imported, causing crashes when importing.
     - Fixed an issue where TexTools would not load hand models when being opened from model ID search.
     - Fixed an issue where version check was retrieving the incorrect version number.
     - Fixed an issue where index offsets were not being written correctly to the extra model data.
     - Fixed an issue where the saved directory for UI items was incorrect.
