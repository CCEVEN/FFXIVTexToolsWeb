      Application:
        - Added a scrollable message box so that it does not run off the screen. (Thanks to Soralin)

      3D:
        - Camera now retains its position when switching between models in the same category. (Thanks to Soralin)

      Bug Fixes:
        - Fixed an issue where TexTools was unable to access .dat1 for 0a, and would crash.
        - Fixed an issue where the decimal separator for different languages would change to a comma, which made it import/export incorrectly.
        - Fixed an issue where if two consecutive parts of a mesh had been deleted, it would cause TexTools to crash on import.
        - Fixed an issue where TexTools would crash if some meshes had secondary texture coordinates for one mesh but not another.
        - Fixed an issue where MeshParts for LoDs other than the primary were being written incorrectly to the MDL file, causing the DX9 client to crash.
        - Fixed an issue where Start Over would place the modlist in the default location even if a custom directory had been set.
