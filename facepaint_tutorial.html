          In this tutorial I'll be combining eye shadow with freckles<br/>

          First we open both files we're going to combine in Photoshop<br/>

          <br/>
          We then copy and paste one of the textures on top of the other, you'll want to paste what you want to add on top of the texture you are looking to replace. <br/>
          In my case I'll be pasting on top of the freckles texture, so that when I select freckles in game it will have both.<br/>
          <br/>

          This will create 2 layers, one for each of the textures<br/>

          Now, there are several ways to do this, but essentially we want to delete the black part of the top layer<br/>

          I used the magic wand tool, set the tolerance to 15 and selected anywhere black<br/>

          <br/>
          I then just hit Delete on the keyboard<br/>

          Which leaves me with this<br/>

          <br/>

          Then in the Layer menu we either Merge Visible or Flatten Image<br/>

          All that's left to do now is save as usual, File > Save as, change Save as type to D3D/DDS, overwrite existing, and save as a DXT1<br/>

          Then import in the application.<br/>

          Here's the end result in-game<br/>
