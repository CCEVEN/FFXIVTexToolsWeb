      <p><h1><b>Tools Needed</b></h1>
      <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
      <li>DDS Plugins</li><br/>

      Nvidia Texture Tools Plugin: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop" target="_blank">https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop</a><br/>

      Intel Texture Tools Plugin: <a href="https://gametechdev.github.io/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin/" target="_blank">https://gametechdev.github.io/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin/</a></p>

  <div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Note:</b> Both are needed in order to load and save color files properly</div>

     <p><h1><b>The Application</b></h1>
         When opening the application for the first time you will be asked to locate your FFXIV data folder.<br/>

         This is where the game installs by default:            
         <div class="alert alert-info"><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\sqpack\ffxiv</b></div>

      <br/>
  <h2><b>Explorer</b></h2>
    After a very short loading time the list of textures will populate.<br/>
    You will find that the list is sorted into categories including: equipment slots, character, summons, minions, etc.<br/>
    The items within these categories are sorted alphabetically to make it easier to find certain textures. <br/>

      <div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Note:</b> The Extra category seems to be food items which may have actual in game models, but I haven't looked into it as of yet so you can only view the names.</div><br/>


  <h2><b>Search</b></h2>
  You may also use the search function accessed from the Search > Find menu for quick access to specific textures.<br/>

  <b>Go To</b> will take you to the texture selected.<br/>


  <h2><b>After Selecting an Item</b></h2>
  When a texture is selected and loaded, the default Race, Texture Map, and Part will be selected.<br/>

  If there is only 1 available item to select, the drop down will be disabled. This makes it easier to determine if there are multiple Races, Texture Maps, or Parts for that item.<br/>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/vI8GJkb.png" alt="DropDown"><br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Race</b><br/>
  <li>The application will determine if the item has multiple textures associated with specific races and add those races to the drop down</li>
  <li>It is important to note, that most textures are shared among all races, in which case the default race will be selected and the drop down menu will be disabled.</li>
  <li>Midlander Male is the common default race for Male Only and Regular equipment textures</li>
  <li>Midlander Female is the common default race for Female Only equipment textures</li>
  <br/>
  <b>Texture Map</b><br/>
  There are 4 types of available textures and a ColorSet that can appear in the Texture Map drop down.<br/>
  <br/>
  <li>Diffuse - A type of color map, in FFXIV a stain or dye can sometimes go over or get mixed with this texture</li>
  <li>Normal - Gives the illusion of height based on light reflections</li>
  <li>Specular - Affects the reflectiveness or how shiny a texture is</li>
  <li>Mask - A layer type texture that allows changes without modifying the original texture</li>
  <li>ColorSet - A 4x16 texture that determines the colors of a model, the location of the color in the model is determined by the alpha channel of the Normal Map</li>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <b>Part/Num</b><br/>
  <li>This dropdown shows the part or number for some models have different parts to them, such as Head+Body category, crafting tools, character faces, and more.</li>

  <h2><b>Saving, Importing, and Reverting</b></h2>
  The options available for each texture:<br/>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VB7DXvP.png" alt="Control Buttons"><br/>
  <br/>

  <li>Save PNG - Saves the texture as a regular .png file, used if you want to upload to a site and show the texture</li>
  <li>Save DDS - Saves the texture as a DirectDraw Surface, this is the file we modify in Photoshop.</li>
  <li>Import - Once a texture has been modified, clicking import will write it into the new .dat3 file and update the index file to point to it</li>
  <li>Revert - This will update the index file to point at the original texture again</li>
  <br/>
  <div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Note:</b> The revert option will remain active even if the game is using the original texture. To check if a texture is modified, see the Active column in the Mod List window.</div>

  Once you've selected a texture you would like to modify you may can click on save DDS to save the texture file.<br/>
  <br/>
  The saved DDS file will be located within the FFXIV TexTools folder in this format:<br/>
  <div class="alert alert-info">Example: FFXIV TexTools/Saved/Body/Hempen Tabard/v15_c0101e0011_top_n.dds</div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Note:</b> Save PNG will save to the same location.</div><br/>

  <h2><b>The Info box</b></h2>
  This will show you relevant information about the texture being viewed.<br/>

  The most important thing to note is the Texture Type, this will tell you in what format you must save the texture from Photoshop.

  <h2><b>Settings</b></h2>
