      <p><b><h1>Transparency</h1></b>
      The transparency of a texture is modified in the <b>Normal Texture Map</b>.<br/>

      <br/>        
      Save and open the texure in Photoshop, making sure to select <b>Load Transparency as Alpha channel</b> <br/>

      Once the texture is open in Photoshop we then go to channels<br/>

      <br/>        
      The channel that will affect the transparency of the model is the blue channel. <br/>
      Before selecting that channel however, I recommend selecting what part of the texture we would like to make transparent first.<br/>

      <br/>
      Like so:<br/>

      <br/>
      With our selection made we then go to the blue channel<br/>

      <br/>
      Here we color in the selected parts of the texture black<br/>

      <br/>
      By checking the info box in the application we see that the texture is a <b>DXT5</b>, so we save as a DXT5 texture using the NVIDIA plugin.<br/>

      If you are still on the same texture in the application just click on import, or head back to it and then hit the import button.<br/>
      <br/>
      Here's the in-game before and after picture, notice the pieces we colored black are nowS gone.<br/>
